# Blog_Server
I am actually starting the backend over for my blog, luckily I did not really do much so its not a complete loss. I decided for the backend stack to be Apollo Server, GraphQL Nexus, and MongoDB (might change). Of course since we are using nexus, this means I will be using TypeScript as the main language here.
